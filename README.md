# A Tiny Hollow Knight-Inspired Demo

A tiny imitation of *Hollow Knight*.

Built with **libGDX**, this is a small-scale project inspired by the boss fight against Hornet.

## 3 Advanced Concepts

1. **Game Engine (GUI)**:
   I use **libGDX** as the base platform to develop the game. It helps manage game assets (animations), detect collisions, debug, and more.
2. **State Machine**:
   For the boss logic, I use a state machine, which makes the structure and movement logic easy to control and extend.
3. **Database**:
   I use **SQLite** to store the game's completion time and display it at the end of the game.
